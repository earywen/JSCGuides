Hey, what's going on guys? Kamazi here. This is going to be our testing uh and basically kill of heroic uh Chimeas I think from the dream rift raid in Midnight Beta. Uh this is going to be or this is the one boss raid in Midnight Beta. This raid only has one boss. Clarify again. Uh I'm going to go over the boss here briefly with like a we're going to watch basically the VOD of us killing it here. And then once that's over, I'll put a actual like full kill after that if you guys want to watch it

without me yapping or anything. We played a handful of specs here. If you're a warlock, a demon modest in this fight. If you want to see different specs, I played a bunch of them over today's testing. There's four bosses. We're going to have this and one other boss coming up right now on YouTube and probably the other two later on tonight, tomorrow morning. Uh, but all the bosses will be coming out. So, go check that out. There's also a playlist linked up here somewhere probably to all the boss

we're testing. Uh, that'll be the case. Uh, so yeah, if you want to check like multiple specs for lock, I probably say check the VA on Twitch or on YouTube because they're going to be there as well. But, uh, yeah, that's that. So, Chimeas is the, uh, only boss in the Dream Rift. It is a one boss raid and the difficulty of the boss, this is heroic, did not seem honestly that bad. Um, now as far as like mechanics in the fight and such go, it's really rinse and repeat once you get it down. Uh, so what

we did here, we had different groups assigned. Groups one and three go the first soak and then two and four go in the second. And I'll tell you what that means in a moment here. So the boss is pulled as your room. You fight on this platform here. It's sort of small and area denial is an important part of this fight with all the poo on the floor. You'll see it coming in a second here. So, boss is pulled over here, get a bit of a burn on him for about 10 seconds before he starts doing his thing. Here

he begins casting rift emergence, which uh he cast over there. Uh and the big thing here, [laughter] um basically is he's going to target somebody, one of the tanks, uh with a alm dust upheaval. So, it's going to put this circle around one of the tanks. Uh and basically, you want to put a certain number of DPS and healers in this to go downstairs. Uh it's going to split you between like the realm you're in now and like a shadow realm or whatever. Uh once that happens, he's going to basically

knock you down or knock you up in the air, knock you down in the shadow realm. And these ads spawn. I believe it's from the upheaval he cast a minute ago. Um or not the upheaval, the dust or whatever. They come in here and what you're going to do, back up a bit here. Uh they're going to come in here. You want to stack them up if you can as much as possible and be in like a centralish location cuz wherever they die, if you go back here and watch this right there, uh it's going to leave this pool of yellow like

poo behind wherever they die. you're trying to stack them up for less area of denial, so you have more space to remove, right? Uh you're going to have a bunch of small ads and a colossal horror. Um now, when they die, they don't just disappear. So both the shades and the horror, when the shield's broken, they go to the upstairs realm. So you're going to be fighting them upstairs if you didn't go down with this route. Um the yellow circles here are also cleared by a debuff upstairs that

player gets you can run on top of them and get the spell that it will clear the pools. Um, so you want you want to try and stack them in a pretty precise area so you're not like, you know, spreading them all over the room so you can then clear them with a dispel or two, right? So these shades are going to die fast here. Once you break the shield, they're going to pop upstairs so they die really fast. There they go. One, two, three, all gone basically. Uh, these pools are appearing. And then upstairs, someone's

standing here with the debuff on them. I don't know if you can see on raid frames. Uh, I don't think you can, but either way, they're going to get dispelled right about now. And they're they're going to clear the pools, which happen. It's right there. that blue circle, right? Uh he gets the spell. They're all cleared. Perfect. The ads are upstairs now. We need to kill the horror. Uh break this shield to put it upstairs as well before uh basically we get ported back upstairs. We have a

debuff on us for I think 22 more seconds roughly right about there before we get pulled back upstairs. So once we kill this thing, shield's broken. Leaves uh poo behind. It's upstairs now. We're still downstairs. But the whole time down here, you can hit the boss for full damage. So that's good. Once you're upstairs, upstairs, you'll see in a minute here, uh, you have to kill the ads. See, he's like fixated on the boss with that red beam before he reaches it. He reaches it, the boss consumes him,

gets a damage increase, and does damage to the raid, I believe. Uh, yep, that rift emergence there as well. You can see it spawning the little like ads in the edge of the room here. Right after we're back upstairs, the next upheaval begins. So, group two basically, which is for us, it's groups two and four are going down. So, you're debuffed for a minute here. You can't go down again a second time. It's one per phase. They go down. He jumps on them. And now they're downstairs fighting the ads. You'll see

the little ads start popping up right about now. And we need to kill them. So, they're being gripped in downstairs. You can see them. Here they come. We got to kill them upstairs. They're focusing on the boss here. Uh, stuns do work here. CC's, incaps, all that. Uh, ring, all that stuff. Leg sweep, shadow fury. You're good. Uh, and once the larger ad comes upstairs, uh, once again, need to kill him also. That's phase one. Pretty simple. Not a whole lot to it. Uh yeah. Oh, actually I

had the dispel here. Perfect. There you go. Good to see you. So I can run in here. Dispel me. Dispel me, Jack. Dispel me. Maybe eventually. Dispel me. Bam. There you go. Perfect. Cool. And it clears the pools. So there's that. That's phase one. Uh he's going to cast consume uh at the end of phase one. Basically, if there are any ads up, uh he's going to consume them and give himself a stack a stacking damage increase. It's permanent for the rest of the fight. Now, this fight was bugged today. Um, there are no

ads live here. As you can see, he's beginning the cast and consume. He's going to channel it down too. Uh, here's his basic uh here's the consume like effect being channeled down by the actual like uh icon here. And this uh there are no ads present. So no, there are no ads. He shouldn't consume any. But unfortunately, it's bugged. He consumes eight every time. Uh seven or eight uh for some reason at the end of phase one for us. And he also heals from 43 to like 60, I think. Right. So watch

this. He goes from 43 to 42 to 54 and he gets seven stacks. So he has a permanent 70% damage increase rest of the fight. Uh and it was bugged at the end of both phase ones. So basically we killed him a bunch of times but he kept healing stuff. So it's like what can you do? Um intermission begins here where he flies away. This is baitable. He's going to do like a breath uh like like a bunch of dragon bosses do. A breath across the room. It's baitable on players. So, we're trying to stack in like a line

either across the room here or here. It's going to put yellow like uh poo on the ground again. Basically, uh it's right here. This gray thing. It's sort of how uh it's like it's almost like how ran you have to look with the winds. It's more like arcane looking. You can bait that. It puts poo in the ground. Uh some ads spawn in here. Typically a mix of like an essence and a big guy and smaller ads. I think the last set doesn't have a big guy in it though. Uh but regardless, this is baitable. So,

what we're going to try and do here, maybe not in this set specifically, but you want to try and stack in the little crevices here, because you can bait this in the exact same direction to where it overlaps with the previous line, and it leaves more room to move around, which you can then clear with the spells, so on and so forth. Right? So, we're killing ads here. It'll breath a few times. It's going to breath again in the second tier. We might have baited it, right? Maybe not have. I don't know. We

might not have been aware of it here fully, but uh let's see what happens. Ad's going to die. Someone has a dispel spell. So, it went the wrong way. It's fine. If we were stacked differently, probably would have been baited differently, but that's okay. So, there's our dispel over there. We're holding this dispel. We're not breaking it yet until this line comes out. Then, they're going to move in here and clear all this in the middle of the room. Even if like the very edge of the dispel

overlaps with the very edge of a circle, like if this was overlapping like barely with anything else, it will still clear that circle. So, super easy to clear. No big deal. He moves in, calls for a dispel, bang, the whole room's clear. More ads come in. Killing ads again. Uh you're going to have one more line coming in. There's kicks in this fight, too. Kick the ads. Super easy. One more line coming in here as well, which you can bait. As you can see, we're all stacked here. Baiting again. Uh same

thing. Going to have more ads coming in. I don't think there's a set of ads or a bigger ad in this set. This is smaller. Three shades and an essence. Um there's a dispel coming in. Uh there's a flem cast coming out uh in 3 seconds here as well. There might be one more line. There could be four. Not sure. I think there I think there might be no. Okay, the timer is off. Yeah, so it's three lines. He's going to dive down. This does big damage. It hurts uh defense of this. And guess

what? That's the whole fight. There's more ads spawning in in second phase one. Uh if you get a third phase one, there's more and more and more. Um that's the fight though, pretty much. Uh you go downstairs, you're going to have an all that's upheaval right about now. Go downstairs again. Um there's more ads. I'm show you that too. Uh, I'll put this full video or this full like pull kill after this section of the video as well if you want to see it without me

yapping. But there's more ads. You kill them, you go upstairs, you CC them, you kill them. That's the fight literally. Um, on mythic, it's different. People will get debuffed down here randomly with a a debuff that has to have you swap sides basically. And a person upstairs will need to stand on top of you to come downstairs and pull you upstairs. And that'll change the fight's like difficulty, I think, by a decent bit. It'll make it a lot more uh involved or engaging. Uh I thought this

boss would be a little more challenging for like the only boss in a one boss raid, but it seemed like it's probably tuned around like third boss difficulty roughly in, you know, a normal raid pacing and cadence. So, it's a fun fight. It's sort of simple, but honestly, um the pacing felt good. And for the first boss of testing in general, uh of anything, like for Midnight was solid. Yeah. >> Hope they don't freeze again. >> I hope you do. >> The hell. [laughter]

>> Oh, I'm playing bug drain or I'm playing drain soul. Uh, it's bugged. I need to play shadow bolt for this. Boom. That's pretty good. >> Yo, AF is zooming right now. Holy moly. Wait, you want to you want to hold that dispell right until the big guy gets broken up? >> Yeah, definitely. >> Uh, same thing. >> Oh [ __ ] I couldn't make it there. [ __ ] Unfortunately, Maleficent Grasp is broken with drain soul. So, I mean, >> no spell. >> This is probably a big So, the seeds

like pad fight, but I mean padding and killing them all different things. >> If you can. >> Yeah. So, now we'll put it behind. Wait, wait, wait. Don't spell yet. >> No. >> All right, now you can go. >> Yeah, that's good. >> Oh, you're on swap big. >> All right, he's got nothing to consume. >> All right, >> see if he's a filthy liar again. >> Filthy rat. >> He is. He ate seven. >> He just got seven stacks.

>> What the [ __ ] bro? [laughter] >> How many puddles do we have on the ground? >> One. >> One. >> Maybe one equals seven. Have you thought of that? >> Yeah, that makes sense. >> Six more. And he got six. >> Great. >> I wonder if it's proximity like the closest. >> It could be. >> We should try standing like in the exact same way. >> See if it just made the line in the same spot. Oh yeah, just like that >> did last time, right? Once at least just

directly overlapped. >> That fully bait almost like I think it's worth giving me a shot. Yeah, I agree. >> I'm over this boss here. Thanks. [laughter] >> Boss is sick. I feel like I'm playing Xavius. I think we dispelled already, so we're not going to have a spell for this. >> Oh, never mind. >> I mean, I can't wait to win this phase. A go make a bug, too. Like, he are being cleared by dark glare. Uh, there's no for hell color, there's no extent,

there's no stacking of black and soul when you cast. It's very very buggy right now. So I mean like it's cool to see how it plays but I'm not going to play it much longer. It's just buggy here. Like Dark is going to clear out some of my UAS or it's basically fake extensions on UA. I get no black and soul stacks either from UA cast and stuff. It's just rough. So like Hold the dispell until the big guy's out. >> He's almost out. >> Coming out now. Next spell is on the [groaning]

next [ __ ] >> and we're taking extra damage cuz he he's bugged and he's stacking his effect. >> So like I mean there's not much you can do there. Like it just bugged. Yeah, it's just what can you do? just bug >> since he's uh did he have the seven buff the whole time in this phase like him down? >> He doesn't go away. It's permanent. >> Mhm. >> And then he's going to heal on the next fly like 20% last time. >> Did he heal on the first fly or No,

>> he just >> he heals whenever he consumes. So, >> okay. Okay. I didn't see >> he consumed something, >> right? >> So when he got the seven stacks, he healed. >> I didn't see him heal the first one. See, so we killed this boss like three or four times. Basically, this is the fight, but more and more ads spawn like ramps basically. >> They're just like in the corners. He's going to consume them now. >> Everyone but me died in this. So

>> he was going to consume them anyways. >> It's true. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. I I I think um I don't know what's going on with the second one, but >> he Yeah, there you go. >> That was >> like he's going to consume that, but I mean >> [ __ ] every time. >> Yeah. >> What do you mean? So like >> the boss when he cast consume, he eats any remaining ads that are alive like these if they're alive downstairs or upstairs. Uh boar killing.
