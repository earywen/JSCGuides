So, now let's jump over to the second raid location, the dream rift. There's only one boss here, and that's Chimeas, the undret god. This fight is another step up from the previous bosses. Chimeas is constantly spawning ads in this other realm that the journal calls Allen's realm or something that only buffed players can interact with. To get that buff, every so often, the tank gets a big group soak, and several players need to stand in it to split the damage and
gain the ability to attack the ads in Allen's realm. Killing the ads in the other realm causes them to fall into the normal realm and start walking toward the boss, and you have to kill them again before they get to the boss and give them a huge heal and stacking damage buff. So, basically, just alternate soak groups and kite the boss away from the ads. The ads need to die before the boss reaches full energy, starting phase two. In phase two, the boss flies up and starts doing some fire breaths that leave a bunch of bat on the ground. Every breath spawns a bunch of ads that need to be interrupted, grouped, and nuked down. Any ads still alive at the end of the second phase will be consumed by the boss, and then it's just rinse and repeat
